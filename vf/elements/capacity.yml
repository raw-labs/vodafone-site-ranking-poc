  title: Retrieve Vodafone Site Elements with Combined Fixed/Mobile Power Capacity Filters.
  description: This SQL endpoint consolidates both fixed and mobile site records, at the element/system level (element for mobile sites system for fixed sites), augmenting each with aggregated power capacities. Fixed sites are matched by linking the general_equipment_area_code to a site’s code, while mobile sites are matched via the site_name—trimming the “ TXO” component. The query supports a wide range of filters: type of site, domain (mobile or fixed), region, leasehold status, etc. Additionally, min/max parameters allow filtering on key capacity metrics (e.g., running_load_in_kw, reserved_load_in_kw, remaining_power_80_of_n_in_kw). Union logic ensures a unified result set with appropriate capacity fields, and pagination controls limit or offset the returned rows. This design thus provides a single endpoint that can answer capacity-related questions for both fixed and mobile sites under numerous filtering criteria.
