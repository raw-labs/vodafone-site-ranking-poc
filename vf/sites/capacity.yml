  title: Retrieve Vodafone Sites with Combined Fixed/Mobile Power Capacity Filters.
  description: This endpoint retrieves a unified list of Vodafone fixed and mobile sites with power-capacity metrics (remaining capacity in kW, running load in kW, and optional forecasted or reserved loads). It supports filters by site type/category, codes, address, leasehold/freehold, GIS migration, or resilience level. It also provides numeric filters for capacity and load ranges (e.g., remaining_power_capacity_in_kw_minimum, forecasted_load_in_kw_maximum). The query merges data from the fixed capacity and MTX mobile capacity tables, applying corner-case logic for sites like BKLN06 or XGL001 (BMGMTX) so both AC and DC systems can be represented. Use page and page_size to paginate (default 500 rows), and the network_domain parameter to restrict results to only mobile (MTX/LTC) or only fixed sites.
