  title: Retrieve Vodafone Sites with Lease Risk and Ownership Details
  description: This endpoint returns Vodafone sites enriched with lease information and at-risk status, allowing you to filter by site codes, lease risk, and days until lease end. It merges records from vdf.vfsites, vdf.ownership, and vdf.vfbridge to provide each site’s lease start/end dates, tenure, tenancy reference, and whether the lease is “at risk.” The optional parameters let you restrict results to specific site codes (site_codes), lease conditions (is_lease_at_risk), or time windows for upcoming lease ends (less_than_given_days_until_lease_end or greater_than_given_days_until_lease_end). This helps pinpoint sites whose leases are nearing expiration or require attention, providing a clear view of property risks across the Vodafone portfolio.
