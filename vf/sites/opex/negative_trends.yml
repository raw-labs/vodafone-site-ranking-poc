  title: Get sites in strictly decreasing cost order (negative OPEX trends), along with first & last month costs and the drop percentage.
  description: This endpoint identifies sites whose monthly Opex costs (in thousands of GBP) strictly decrease from the beginning to the end of a specified date range. By default, it examines months between min_month and max_month in the given year. Any zero values are treated as missing data and imputed by averaging previous non-missing months. If each subsequent month’s cost is lower (or if a site has no next month in range), the site is flagged as having a negative trend. Various filtering parameters allow you to narrow down by site types, site codes, address, region, leasehold/freehold, status, etc., while additional logic can distinguish mobile vs. fixed domains. The final output includes each qualifying site code’s first and last imputed cost, along with its drop percentage. Essentially this endpoint returns negative OPEX trend data.
