  title: Site OPEX Forecast Endpoint
  description: This endpoint extends the base OPEX summary by applying an annual growth rate to project operational costs for a user-specified number of years. It begins with filtering sites (by type, code, region, etc.), calculates each site’s current-year base cost, then iterates forward in time for up to :forecast_years. The output includes both the original year’s cost and each forecasted year. This helps answer questions like:
“How would the OPEX cost of sites X, Y, Z change over the next 5 years if consumption rises by 24% annually?”
