  title: Identify Siteâ€“Capacity Outliers
  description: This endpoint cross-validates site records and capacity entries (mobile MTX vs. fixed) to pinpoint mismatches or missing references. The final output displays each problematic site code alongside the reason it could not be matched, helping you quickly address inconsistencies. If a comma-separated list of site codes is passed as input, the check is restricted to those codes; otherwise, the all sites are processed.
