  title: Identify Mismatched or Missing Space/Seats/Sections Records for Vodafone Sites
  description: This endpoint detects inconsistencies between the site records and space data. It flags site codes present in one source but missing from the other, returning each code alongside an exclusion_reason (e.g., “Not found in Space data” or “Not found in site data”). This helps highlight incomplete or mismatched records so you can resolve data integrity issues. If you pass a comma-separated list of site codes, only those codes are checked; otherwise, the endpoint reviews all sites. Results are ordered by exclusion reason for easy prioritization.
